In this project , I analysed the data based on various parameters such as Age, Gender, State, quantity etc. and created an interactive dashboard out of it.

The following insights are derived out of this project:
1. Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~65%)
2. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are top 3 states(~35%)
3. Adult age group is(30-49 years) is max contributing(~50%)
4. Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing(~80%)

FINAL CONCLUSION TO IMPROVE VRINDA STORE SALES:
